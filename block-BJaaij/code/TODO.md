## An object-oriented book-list!

_[ ] Create a class BookList
_[ ] Create another class called Book

#### BookLists should have the following properties:

1. Number of books marked as read
2. Number of books marked not read yet
3. A reference to the next book to read (book object)
4. A reference to the current book being read (book object)
5. A reference to the last book read (book object)
6. An array of all the Books

#### Each Book should have several properties:

1. Title
2. Genre
3. Author
4. Read (true or false)
5. Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a JS Date() object

Every Booklist should have a few methods:
-add(book)

- [ ] should add a book to the books list.

-finishCurrentBook()

- [ ] should mark the book that is currently being read as "read"
- [ ] Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())
- [ ] Change the last book read to be the book that just got finished
- [ ] Change the current book to be the next book to be read
- [ ] Change the next book to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books
